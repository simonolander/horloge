Horloge offers a gentle approach to time management through customizable chimes, allowing users to tailor reminders to their specific needs.

With Horloge, you can create personalized chimes for different activities such as workouts, yoga sessions, or routine tasks. For instance, set a guitar to strum every 30 seconds to pace your stretching routine, or play a bell every minute to refocus a wandering mind during meditation.

The app provides a range of sounds to choose from, including guitar strings to create harmonies, and percussion using various objects. Multiple sounds with various intervals and delays can be combined, allowing highly customizable chimes for different activities. Chimes are saved locally on your device, you do not need to set up an account.

Horloge integrates with other media on your device, allowing you to play your chimes alongside podcasts or music.
